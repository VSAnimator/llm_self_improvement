Goal: Combine the ingredients to make *microscope*. You may only combine two entities at a time. You can take only two steps to make the final product.
Plan: None
Reasoning: To achieve the goal of making a *microscope*, we need to identify the most relevant ingredients from the available options. A microscope typically requires components that can magnify small objects, which often involves the use of lenses. Sand can be used to create glass, which is essential for making lenses. Electricity can provide the energy to convert sand into glass.
Selected action: Action(text='"sand, electricity"')
Obs: Ingredients available:  1:electricity, 2:sand, 3:bacteria, 4:glass , Reward: 0.0
Step 1 of 2
Valid actions: []
Reasoning: Now that we have combined sand and electricity to create glass, we can proceed to the next step in achieving our goal of making a microscope. Glass is essential for creating the lenses that are crucial for magnifying small objects in a microscope, and Bacteria is the type of specimen that can be observed under a microscope.
Selected action: Action(text='"glass, bacteria"')
Obs: Ingredients available:  1:electricity, 2:sand, 3:bacteria, 4:glass, 5:microscope , Reward: 1.0
